# FIFA Player Value Prediction

### Predicting a player's market value based on his traits using linear regression
This project is my attempt at the Kaggle ML Hackathon: [Kick-Off 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kick-off) organised by Shaastra, IIT Madras.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kick-off/data) provided is extracted from EA’s FIFA 18-20 game, 70% of the data is used as training data, and the rest 30% as test data. The targeted field is “value” in the training dataset, and the submission CSV is a prediction of the id of the most valued player, from the given set of ids.
